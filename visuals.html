<p>This plot will have the number of delayed flights on the x-axis and
the number of cancelled flights on the y-axis. Each point on the scatter
plot will represent a specific airport, with the color of the point
indicating the region. The size of each point will be determined by the
duration of the delay time. We also adds text to each point that will
appear when hovering over the point. The text will display information
about the region, including the total number of arrival flights, the
number of cancelled arrivals, and the number of delayed arrivals.</p>

This map shows the proportion of delayed flights of the airports in the
US. Where blue indicates low proportion of cancels and red indicates
high proportion of cancels. We can see that there are a higher
proportion of cancelled flights in the coastal region and eastern part
of US. This is very similar with the flight delay observations.

This map shows the proportion of cancelled flights of the airports in
the US. Where blue indicates low proportion of cancels and red indicates
high proportion of cancels. We can see that there are a higher
proportion of cancelled flights in the coastal region and eastern part
of US. This is very similar with the flight delay observations.

This map gives us an overview of wind speed in the US. Where blue
indicates high wind speed and green indicates low wind speed. We can see
that the wind is stronger in middle region and coastal region. Some
regions overlap with the regions with high flight delay and cancel
rates.
