> We explored the question "What factors contribute to flight delays caused by weather?"
> We found that the proportion of delayed flights cause by weather differs by geographic location. 
> Using linear model we found that visibility distance and wind speed have a negative relationship with proportion of weather delays, whereas relative humidity have a positive relation ship with it. 
> Using random forest models, which can model non-linear relationship, we found that the top 3 factors contributing to the proportion of delayed flights are visibility distance, relative humidity and wind speed.
