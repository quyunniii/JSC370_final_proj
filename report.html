<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
Flight delays can have significant impacts on airlines, passengers, and
airport operations, leading to financial losses and inconvenience for
travelers. Understanding the causes of flight delays and their
relationship with climate conditions can help airlines and passengers
avoid the potential negative effect. We will focus on airports located
in the United States and the climate near these airports.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
IATA code refers to the three-letter code assigned by the International
Air Transport Association (IATA) to airports, airlines, and other
aviation organizations. The IATA code is used to standardize and
simplify air travel communications, such as flight itineraries, baggage
tags, and ticketing. For airports, the IATA code usually consists of
three letters that identify a specific airport. For example, JFK is the
IATA code for John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.
Here, we will use the IATA code to uniquely identify airports and join
different data sets.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) is a United States federal
agency that is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating
information on all modes of transportation in the United States. The
agency was established in 1992 and is a part of the Department of
Transportation. The primary goal of the BTS is to provide accurate and
reliable data on transportation systems to support policy-making,
research, and decision-making by government agencies, businesses, and
the public. The agency collects and analyzes data on a wide range of
transportation topics; we will mainly be using the data set that
includes information on the number of delayed and cancelled flights, the
airlines involved, the causes of delays, the length of delays, the
departing airport, and the IATA code of the airport.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
The “OurAirports” project is an open-source initiative that provides
detailed information on airports around the world. The project was
launched in 2007 and is maintained by a community of volunteers who
collect and verify data on airports from a variety of sources. The goal
of the project is to provide accurate and up-to-date information on
airports that can be used by a wide range of stakeholders, including
aviation professionals, researchers, and travelers. The data provided by
the project includes information on airport locations, runways,
facilities, and services, as well as details on the number of flights
and passengers at each airport. We will be using the part of data set
includes airports in the United States with the IATA code, the location,
longitude, and latitude.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
Additionally, we will work with the meteorological data presented in
lecture consisting of weather station readings in the continental US. We
will primarily be looking at the temperature, elevation, wind speed,
visibility distance, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, latitude,
and longitude in this data set.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
In this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into the question:
“What are the factor that contribute to weather flight delays?”
</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<div id="data-collection" class="section level4">
<h4>Data Collection</h4>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
The flight delay data were taken from
<a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?20=E">The
Bureau of Transportation Statistics website</a>. Under where it says
Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes, there is a query to select
the data. We took the data for all carriers and all airlines form
November 2017 to November 2022. The airport locations data were
downloaded from
<a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ourairports-usa">Ourairports
project website</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning-and-wrangling" class="section level4">
<h4>Data Cleaning and Wrangling</h4>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
In this part, we will discuss the data cleaning, filtering, and joining
performed on the data sets. We first cleaned the three datasets
separately, and then joined them to make the complete cleaned data for
our analysis.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
There wasn’t any concerns with the range of the data when we looking at
the summary of the variables. There are 4 columns of interests that
contains “NAs”, so we will be removing these rows with missing values.
These columns included “arr_flights”, “arr_cancelled”, “arr_del15”,
“arr_delay”. By removing these rows, we were able to ensure that our
analysis was based on complete data.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
We noticed that the “latitude_deg” and “longitude_deg” columns were
stored as character strings. To perform any geographical analysis, we
needed these columns to be numeric. To convert these columns, we convert
the values from character to numeric data type. By doing this, we were
able to ensure that our analysis was based on complete and relevant
data.To gain a better understanding of the data set, we used the
summarized the columns of interests to generate descriptive statistics
for several variables in the data set. These variables included
“latitude_deg”, “longitude_deg”, region_name, and “iata_code”. The
“latitude_deg” and “longitude_deg” variables represented the latitude
and longitude coordinates of the airports, while the other variables
were related to airport codes and regions.After cleaning the data, we
filtered the data set to remove rows with missing values in the columns
of interests.By removing these rows, we were able to ensure that our
analysis was based on complete and relevant data.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
We first summarized the ‘met’ data set to generate descriptive
statistics for variables of interest. These variables include: “temp”,
“elev”, “wind.sp”, “vis.dist”, “rh”. After examine the maximum and
minimum of these variables, we found some usual values. These include
the temperature of -40 and elevation of 9999. We replaced these values
were with “NA”. Then, the met_subset variable is created by selecting
only certain columns of interest from the ‘met’ data set: latitude,
longitude, temperature, elevation, wind speed, visibility distance,
atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity. Since there is only
information for year and month in the flight delay data set, we will
take the mean for the columns of interest in met_subset for each weather
station. We expect larger airports to have more flights delays since
there are more flights in larger airports. To more closely focus on the
effect of weather on flight delays, we calculate a new column for the
proportion of delays caused by weather. This is calculated by dividing
the the number of weather delay by number of arrival delay for each
airport.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
The Haversine formula is a mathematical formula used to calculate the
shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, such as
the Earth. It is commonly used in navigation and geography to calculate
distances between two points specified by their latitude and longitude
coordinates. The formula takes into account the curvature of the Earth’s
surface and calculates the shortest distance between two points along
the surface of a sphere. It works by first converting the latitude and
longitude coordinates of the two points into radians, and then using the
difference between the latitudes and longitudes to calculate the angular
distance between the two points. This angular distance is then used to
calculate the great circle distance between the two points using the
Haversine formula. We will use the Haversine formula to find the closest
weather station to each airport.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
The two data frames delay_subset and airports were merged based on a
common column IATA code. The merged data frame is then grouped by
airport, and summary statistics are calculated for each airport, such as
the total number of arriving flights, the number of cancelled flights,
the number of delayed flights, and the total delay time. The longitude
and latitude coordinates for each airport are also kept, as well as the
name of the airport’s region. The resulting data frame contains one row
per airport, with columns for each of the calculated summary statistics.
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
The resulting data frame is merged with the “met_subset” data frame to
create a Cartesian product of the two data frames. Then, the distance is
calculated between the airport and weather station locations using the
Haversine formula. The resulting data frame is again grouped by the
“airport” column and the row with the minimum distance is selected for
each group. The final output data frame contains information on the
airport, its closest weather station, delay statistics, and airport
location information. This data set will hopefully provides valuable
insights into the relationship between airport delays and weather
patterns. Table 1 shows a subset of our dataset.

In order to find the relationship between different weather condition
indicators and the proportion of flight delays, we will use linear model
and random forest model. We will fit linear regression models to the
data, with the proportion of weather delayed flights as the response
variable and the other variables as predictor variables. The linear
regression models will provide estimates of the effects of each
predictor variable on the proportion of weather delayed flights. We will
also be traning a random forest model which will help us model the
non-linear relationship if it exist.

The table above shows the mean proportion of delayed flights because of
the weather for each state in the US. We see that the statistics
significantly differs by state. For Alaska, the proportion of weather
delayed flights was 0.132 and . This number is significantly lower for
Arizona, which have a weather flight delay proportion of 0.011. In this
table, we see that the proportion of wather delayed flights varies by
geographic region.

Figure 4 shows the relationship between wind speed near the airport and
proportion of flight delayed cause by weather in the airport. The
horizontal axis (X-axis) represents the wind speed and the vertical axis
(Y-axis) represents the proportion of flight delay, measured as a
proportion from 0 to 1. The point are colored by temperature. Each point
on the scatter plot represents a specific airport, with the wind speed
and proportion of flight delay for that point plotted as a coordinate.
We see a generally downward trend with the two variables. As wind speed
increases, the proportion of flight delay decreases. There are no
outliers or unusual observations.

<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
Table 3 is the summary for this linear model of wind speed near the
airport and proportion of flight delayed. The intercept coefficient of
0.0913 represents the estimated value of y when wind speed is 0. The
coefficient for wind speed is -0.0094, indicating that for every unit
increase in wind speed, the estimated value of y decreases by 0.0094.
Therefore, there is a negative relationship between wind speed and
proportion of weather delayed flights, meaning that as wind speed
increases, the value of proportion of weather delayed flights tends to
decrease.

Table 4 is the summary for the linear model of visibility distance near

is 0. The coefficient for visibility distance is really small, because
of the huge difference in the values of visibility distance and
proportion of delayed flights. However, looking at the P-value,
visibility distance is a good predictor for proportion of delayed
flights. There is a negative relationship between visibility distance
and proportion of weather delayed flights, meaning that as visibility
distance increases, the value of proportion of weather delayed flights
tends to decrease.

<h2>Conclusion and Summary</h2>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
In this report, we hope to answer the question “What factors contribute
to flight delays caused by weather?”. From our summary of the data, we
found that the proportion of delayed flights cause by weather differs by
geographic location. Using linear model we found that visibility
distance and wind speed have a negative relationship with proportion of
weather delays, whereas relative humidity have a positive relation ship
with it. Next, we further investigate this relationship with random
forest models, which can model non-linear relationship. With this model,
we found that the top 3 factors contributing to the proportion of
delayed flights are visibility distance, relative humidity and wind
speed.

<div id="limitations" class="section level4">
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:12pt">
There are several limitations to this project. First, the amount of data
we are able to use is small. The flight delay data we have is summed for
each day not every hour. Since weather conditions can change relatively
fast, daily summaries might not be enough information. Another
limitation is the model we used, although random forest is powerful for
regression task, it’s difficult to interpret. We weren’t able to see in
which direction each variable contributed to the result.
